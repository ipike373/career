<center><h1>Why it matters to Me</h1></center>
<center><h3>My Life influenced by a Leader<br>

		<p>My Uncle Bernard has imposed a very significant impact on my life. I have learned by example what it means to be a leader. Leaders lead by example. They don&apos;t destroy other hard workers, they raise future leaders. My uncle gave me the most valuable resource I could ever have. </p>

	<p>My uncle owned a billboard business until a recession hit and ended his business in 2008. Before that year, as a child, I had every toy I wanted. I was six years old at the time, and I had been watching him my entire life. I shared a room with my cousin until we moved to a different neighborhood to accommodate for our growing family in 2006, paid for by my uncle&apos;s own business. For 2 years I was growing and watching how he spoke to the men that worked for him. I always wondered: how does Uncle Bernard make so much money when he didn&apos;t do any work himself? The answer was in his head. It was the simple fact that he was the man with the knowledge needed to get the job done. The men working for him were pawns of sorts, and he was the king. He would show them how to fasten tarps, assemble and disassemble parts of a billboard, and use his assembly of tools in the proper fashion. I took notice of all of these as he would show me, and I was fascinated with their names.</p>

	<p>The recession in 2008 demolished his career, as well as my family&apos;s income. My uncle went into a deep depression and got sick. He got emphysema from chain-smoking for hours, and a tumor gathered as a cancer manifested itself inside of his lungs. He would pass the tumor over many months of radiation treatment. This, however, left a scar that wouldn&apos;t heal. Out of the hospital, but ultimately, in his newly disabled and depressed state, he began taking pills. He started selling his tools and cranes to keep up with money. I began forgetting their names as collections of his gear was pawned and discarded. The shed that stands in my backyard has become run down and nearly empties of all useful utilities, save for a lawn mower I bought, and boxes of things not stored in the house. It&apos;s cluttered with leaves and rat droppings. </p>


	<p>I&apos;m proud of my uncle for being able to try so hard to provide for his family. I want to show him that it&apos;s okay that he got sick; that I can take his place and do better with everything he&apos;s taught me. I am adamant on keeping him content with the legacy he&apos;s leaving behind. I&apos;ve learned the most in life from watching his progress and regress up to this point. From his experiences I am confident that I will be able to surpass him. His shed will one day no longer be vacant.</p>

	<p>I&apos;ve always been told I would make a formidable civil engineer. I never understood what one was until I researched it myself. When I saw a webpage full of pictures of men in hard hats working with a crew, it reminded me of him. Except, instead of billboards, as a civil engineer, I&apos;d be working on a team of other skilled workers, planning layouts for big building projects. I would have my own assortment of tools, each with its own name and unique purpose. As a member of a larger group, if a recession hits, I won&apos;t lose my entire business like he did. Until I&apos;m older when I begin my own business projects, being a member of a skilled crew would be an optimal outlet to gain experience. Civil Engineering is my outlet. I will join a team and learn first how to follow orders from a boss. I will invest the money I earn, and what isn&apos;t invested will go to supporting my family. Then I will learn how to be a better boss than my uncle was. Many years from now, my investments will support a new family of my own, and I&apos;ll teach them how to be successful. I&apos;ll tell them stories of Bernard and how he taught me to be a leader. I&apos;ll teach them the names of all of my tools and show them their unique purposes, and most importantly, I&apos;ll show them how to create other leaders. </p>
