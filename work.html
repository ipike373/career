<center><p>Civil engineering is about maintaining and adapting citywide infrastructure that we depend on every day, like streets, buildings, sewers,railways, and bridges. Civil engineers work with contractors and architects on jobsights with the goal in mind to design the best possible layout of a city. Engineers tpyically work with a team of other skilled engineers. They arrive on site to log and keep track of damages and potential renovations necessary to keep infrastructure functioning and modern. </p>
